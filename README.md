# NLP-Topic Modeling - White House Press Briefings #

## Topic Modeling
1. Scrape The American Presidency Project to get White House press briefing transcripts for presidential terms of G.W. Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump. [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/saranaweera/NLP-Topic_Modeling-White_House_Press_Briefings/blob/master/TopicModeling/whiteHousePressBriefings.scrape.ipynb)
2. Clean up transcripts from the scrape and prep for text analysis. [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/saranaweera/NLP-Topic_Modeling-White_House_Press_Briefings/blob/master/TopicModeling/whiteHousePressBriefings.cleanUpData.ipynb)

## Flask App

Developed a flask app to be an A.I. version of Sean Spicer :)

I'm employed a Markov chain text generator and used Sean Spicer's answers to press questions as the corpus for it. Markov Chain is using a state size of 3.
