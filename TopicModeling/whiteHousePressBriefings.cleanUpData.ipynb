What Sam Nunn, at least the way I heard him say it, he's asking the White House not to do anything yet; let there be this cooling-off period for him to hold hearings; and then some months down the road when they can answer these questions systematically, then the White House can do what it wants to do; and then those members of Congress, if they want to seek legislation, they can do what they want to do.

And you all have declined to address the issue of conduct, at least from the podium, leaving that for tomorrow or later. But it is presumed the President will not deal with that until later -- that will be a part of the overhaul of the military's code of conduct. Is it not somewhat less than ending discrimination against gays in the service to say the ban is dropped based on status, what you say -- what a person declares his sex -- his or her sexual preference to be -- we're still thinking about conduct and homosexual and heterosexual conduct may in fact be treated differently? \"},\n",
       "  {'paragraph': \" MS. MYERS: But I don't think any of those decisions have been made yet. I think that's what -- those are among the complicated and difficult decisions that have to be made. I think there's always been a code of conduct. I think they call it Standards of Behavior in the military that are different than those in civilian life. And there are a lot of things that, I think Senator Nunn pointed out, that there are standards of behavior in the military that are very specific. And how you go about integrating homosexuals into the military and creating a standard of conduct or what have you that is workable is a complicated question, and I think one that will be addressed in the coming weeks and months. \"},\n",

He's talked to a number of people throughout this process as have members of the staff. I think he's well aware of people's feelings, and I think he's sensitive to them.

I think certainly the Joint Chiefs had a lot of questions that need to be answered in this process. Senator Nunn raised a lot of questions that he has and said he would hold hearings on it.

And it's certainly our intention to continue that. It's not always perfect. As hard as you try, there are a lot of members and a lot of people who have thoughts and strong feelings about this. And so it's not always possible, I think, to do as good a job as you start out to. But I think the President feels he's reached out, he's worked very hard to do that.

I think there's been a tremendous amount of exchange of information in the last week since the President was inaugurated, and I think that will continue. And I think that they're not going to agree -- Congress and the President are not going to agree on every single element of every single issue. But I think the American people believe that people should not be excluded from serving their country on the basis of their sexual orientation; and I think there's a lot of people in Congress who feel that way; and the President certainly feels that way.

Is it not somewhat less than ending discrimination against gays in the service to say the ban is dropped based on status, what you say -- what a person declares his sex -- his or her sexual preference to be -- we're still thinking about conduct and homosexual and heterosexual conduct may in fact be treated differently? \"},\n",

And there are a lot of things that, I think Senator Nunn pointed out, that there are standards of behavior in the military that are very specific.
